# Creatively Hacking Creative Commons

## The Hypothesis

The hypothesis to be proved is:

> **"Adding of party information and signatures to an otherwise agreeable Creative Commons license will provide as good or better business value and/or legal outcomes"**


## The Context

This hack is about exploring the question whether two or more parties who desire to negotiate and sign a license to share digital video media via the web can choose to adopt the standard legal terms of a Creative Commons license that adequately reflects their intent (ie: promotes sharing, prevents commercial use, etc) by replacing the legal entity "Creative Commons Corporation" with their own names/addresses and signatures in the familiar form of bilateral contracts?  

**The Parties** 

* Assume the parties possess all required legal capacity and ownership rights necessary to execute a standard license agreement of this type.

* Assume this is not a contract of adhesion context but instead a situation among two or more parties that who voluntarily choose to agreeupon and sign slightly custom license terms (eg requiring perhaps 30 minutes for drating, one or more review/agreement cycles and signature). 

**The Data**

* Assume the video depicts a screenshare walkthrough of an application and a voiceover.

* Assume the video is encoded and formatted as standard .mp4 file of 10-20 megabytes in size

* Assume the video file carries with it metadata set by the licensor in standard formats and structures

```

**The System** 

* Assume the media is posted to Vimeo under standard default settings and terms

* Alternatively assume the media is posted to YouTube under standard default settings and terms

**The License** 

* Assume the licese used to start is the "Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International"  See: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode


# The Evaluation

## Potential Benefits 

> What additional legal benefits, including certainty, is available from including valid signature by explicitly identified parties to the license?  That is, in the event a party breaches terms of the license, would presence of the signature by and identity information about the party against whom enforcement is sought?

## Potential Problems

> How, if at all, does this modification limit or prevent the expected media sharing intended by use of Creative Commons terms? EG: do these modifications have unintended results that thwart rather than enable expected sharing of the media?

## Potential Solutions

> How might parties address unintended consequences with a further tweak of some type such that the inclusion of party information and signatures meets or exceeds practical needs and legal outcomes currently expected from use of this license?
